### Verilog implementation of Serial Communication Protocols 

I am planning to implement the following serial communication protocols as part of my FPGA & verilog learning process.  

Board used is the Terasic DE-10 Lite. These are some of its specs:
    - MAX 10 10M50DAF484C7G Device
    - Integrated dual ADCs, each ADC supports 1 dedicated analog input and 8 dual function pins
    - 50K programmable logic elements
    - 1,638 Kbit M9K Memory
    - 144 18 Ã— 18 Multiplier
    - 4 PLLs
  
Software used is the Quartus Prime (ver 20.1) Lite.  

| Protocol | Date | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| UART     |      |        |
| USART    |      |        |
| I2C      |      |        |
| SPI      |      |        |
| VGA      |      |        |
